# IDEAS

## Keyboard navigation for sliders
Arrow keys (left/right) could step through slider values when a cell is focused. This would complement mouse-based slider interaction for power users reviewing many checkpoints quickly.

## Slider animation / playback mode
A "play" button on the master slider that auto-advances through values at a configurable interval. Useful for quickly scanning through checkpoint progression without manual slider dragging.
