      - "FE: Dropdown width does not exceed viewport width on small screens"
      - "FE: Existing TrainingRunSelector tests still pass"
    notes: |
      Root cause: NSelect inherits width from the 360px AppDrawer, giving only ~200-250px
      for text. User wants the dropdown popover to be wider than the trigger element so
      full names are readable when selecting. Naive UI NSelect supports CSS overrides on the
      dropdown popover (e.g. menu-props or consistent-menu-width=false).

    notes: |
      Two root causes found:
      1. In config.yaml, workflow_dir is at the YAML top level but the parser (yamlComfyUIConfig)
         expects it nested under comfyui:. It is silently ignored, falling back to default "./workflows".
      2. docker-compose.yml does not mount the host's workflows/ directory into the backend container,
         so even with the correct config the container can't see the files.
      Fix: (a) move workflow_dir under comfyui: in config.yaml, (b) add volume mount to both
      docker-compose.yml and docker-compose.dev.yml, (c) update config.yaml.example.

      SamplePresetEditor is not surfaced where the user expects it in the job launch flow.
      Investigate whether JobLaunchDialog imports/renders SamplePresetEditor or only shows a
      read-only PresetSelector dropdown without the editor.

    notes: |
      Root cause: The backend hardcodes http:// and ws:// schemes when constructing ComfyUI
      URLs from host+port. When ComfyUI is behind an HTTPS reverse proxy (port 443), the
      connection fails. A single `url` field is more flexible — supports any scheme, port,
      and path prefix.

    notes: |
      All three subagents independently read the same files during B-020, adding redundant
      token cost. Passing a brief change summary (files + descriptions) from the fullstack
      developer helps downstream agents orient faster without replacing their own code reads.

      Currently the lightbox shows a single static image. Adding a slider lets users flip
      through the slider dimension (e.g. checkpoints) without closing the lightbox, which is
      especially useful for detailed comparison at full resolution.
      The lightbox needs additional props: cell coordinates (xVal, yVal), slider dimension
      values, current slider value, and callbacks to update per-cell slider state.
      App.vue opens the lightbox — it already knows the grid state, so it can pass this context.

      p.name without null-guarding. Fix: (1) add an onCreate handler to NDynamicInput that
      returns {name: '', text: ''}, (2) add null guards in computedTotalImages and canSave.

      built-in arrow key handling may be conflicting with the custom handler — NSlider may be
      consuming the event and jumping to min/max while the custom handler also fires.
      Investigate: (1) whether NSlider keyboard prop or keyboard={false} can disable its built-in
      key handling, (2) whether the custom keydown handler should use stopPropagation/stopImmediate
      to prevent NSlider from also handling the event.
      The "doesn't work when not focused" issue requires the master slider to capture keyboard
      events more broadly — possibly a document-level listener when the slider dimension is active.

    notes: |
      Currently JobLaunchDialog receives trainingRun as a prop from App.vue (sidebar selection).
      Change to: (1) add an internal training run selector that fetches all runs, (2) add job
      status lookup to color-code each option, (3) remove the trainingRun prop dependency.
      May need a new or modified API endpoint to efficiently get job status per training run.

      Backend changes needed:
      - Goa DSL: Add optional checkpoint_filenames ([]string) and clear_existing (bool) to CreateSampleJobPayload
      - API layer: Filter discovered checkpoints by checkpoint_filenames when provided
      - Service layer: When clear_existing is true, call os.RemoveAll on each selected checkpoint's
        sample directory (<sample_dir>/<checkpoint_filename>/) before creating job items
      - The sample directory per checkpoint is: <sample_dir>/<checkpoint_filename_with_extension>/
        (e.g., <sample_dir>/psai4rt-v0.3.0-no-reg-step00004500.safetensors/)

    notes: |
      Two issues merged: (1) Jobs are created as pending but there is no UI Start button and no
      backend auto-start, so jobs never transition to running. (2) Even if started, ComfyUI
      workflow submissions may not be reaching ComfyUI. Root cause is likely that processNextItem()
      only looks for jobs with status=running, but nothing transitions pending→running.
      The executor should poll for pending jobs and auto-start them.

    notes: |
      Root cause: TrainingRunSelector is inside AppDrawer, which is not mounted on narrow screens
      until the user opens it. The auto-select logic lives in TrainingRunSelector's onMounted hook,
      so it never fires. Fix: move auto-select and scan logic to App.vue's onMounted, independent
      of drawer state. TrainingRunSelector can still sync its UI when mounted later.

      The orchestrator currently has no structured mechanism to handle E2E failures beyond

      1. "Root cause documentation in story notes" (high) — richer analysis in notes helps
         developers focus on the correct fix immediately.
      2. "Story notes numeric format spec" (low) — CFG should be floating point, steps and seeds

      Source: agent_workflow idea "QA smoke test consolidation" (low priority).
      User direction: E2E tests are the standard for verification. Manual curl calls and
      similar are only for debugging while writing tests. This aligns with W-001 (QA writes
      E2E tests) and W-002 (QA addresses failing E2E tests).

      2. "Automated nginx WebSocket validation" (low) — prevent regression of B-026 fix.
