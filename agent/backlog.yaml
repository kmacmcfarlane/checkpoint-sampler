    title: "Top nav elements unavailable on narrow screens until drawer opens"
    priority: 50
    status: uat
    requires: []
    acceptance:
      - "FE: On narrow screens (<1024px), the app eagerly loads the saved training run from localStorage and triggers a scan on mount, regardless of drawer state"
      - "FE: Header buttons (Generate Samples, Jobs, Metadata, Live indicator) appear immediately after app load when a saved training run exists"
      - "FE: The drawer's TrainingRunSelector still reflects the auto-selected training run when opened"
      - "FE: On wide screens (>=1024px), behavior is unchanged (drawer auto-opens, training run auto-selects)"
      - "FE: If no saved training run exists in localStorage, the app shows 'Select a training run to get started' as before"
      - "FE: Unit tests for eager loading on narrow screens"
    notes: |
      Root cause: TrainingRunSelector is inside AppDrawer, which is not mounted on narrow screens
      until the user opens it. The auto-select logic lives in TrainingRunSelector's onMounted hook,
      so it never fires. Fix: move auto-select and scan logic to App.vue's onMounted, independent
      of drawer state. TrainingRunSelector can still sync its UI when mounted later.
      Key files: frontend/src/App.vue (onMounted, onTrainingRunSelect),
      frontend/src/components/TrainingRunSelector.vue (auto-select logic),

    notes: |
      The prompt prefix is stored as part of the sample preset in the database and applied at
      generation time, so individual prompt texts remain clean in the editor. The join logic:
      if prefix ends with '. ' or ', ', concatenate directly; otherwise append '. ' between
      prefix and prompt text. Empty prefix means no prepending.

    notes: |
      Bundles five approved enhancement ideas for the Generate Samples dialog:
      1. "Bead count in sidebar" (medium) — visual hint on header button.
      2. "Preset auto-close on save" (low) — reduces clicks.
      3. "Last training run restore in Generate Samples dialog" (low) — resume where left off.

    notes: |
      Large cross-cutting change. The core concept: a "study" defines a set of generation parameters
      and outputs into its own subdirectory, enabling multiple studies per training run with different
      parameter sets. This is the renamed and enhanced version of "sample presets".
