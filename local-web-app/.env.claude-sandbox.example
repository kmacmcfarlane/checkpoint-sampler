# Environment variables for the Claude Code sandbox container.
#
# The claude-sandbox launcher (github.com/kmacmcfarlane/claude-sandbox) passes
# this file to `docker run --env-file`, making every variable available inside
# the container. It looks for .env.claude-sandbox in the project root directory
# (i.e. the directory you run `claude-sandbox` or `make claude` from) and will
# refuse to start if the file is missing.
#
# Setup:
#   cp .env.claude-sandbox.example .env.claude-sandbox
#   # Fill in your values, then run: make claude
#
# This file is gitignored — do not commit it.
